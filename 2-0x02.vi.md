## resources 
### basic vi commands
- 2 modes: command mode(every character inserted, is a command one of which is to enter insert mode) which cause action to be taken on the file, insert mode in which entered text into the file.
- command "i" enters insert, then <Esc> (escape) key turns off the insert mode. commands are case sensitive.
- basic commands: 
+ to use on a file type "vi filename" if it exists, first page of file displays,  if unexsistant, the file is created. -r option recovers the one that was being edited when system crashed.
+ti exit vi, cursor moves to bottom when a colon (:) is typed. this type of commands is completed by hitting <Enter> key. 
+:x <enter> quit vi (vi saves changes automatically whem exited)
+:wq <enter> quit vi without saving changes.
+
+
+
w for write, q for quit, x for ?, ! for ?, 
- beyond basic:
:wq quit while saving, :q quit or exit, #
## summary
- in (vi filename (option -r to recover if system crashed)) and out(:x to exit :w to write changes, :q! quit without saving ),
- (the ^ meant holding <ctrl> while letter is pressed)
- moving the cursor j or enter to move down a line, k or up-arrow to up a line, h or backspace or left arrow for left one char, l or space for one char right, 0 for start of current line, $ for end of current line. nG to move cursor to line n or just G for last line.
- screen manipulation (not basic, and all need ^), f forward, b backord a screen, d down, u back half screen, l redraws the screen, r redraws with removing deleted lines. (redraw when screen gets visually corrupted)
- undo with u. add with i before cursor (untill Esc is hit), a for agter cursor, o for in a starting in new line bellow curent,  O for line above. change text with r to replace. delete (cut because it goes into register 3dd cuts 3 lines)with x for single char under cursor, or dd for entire current line. D for remainder of line and ndd for n lines starting with current. copy or yank is with yy for current line of nyy or next n lines including current into buffer, then p to put or paste in the buffer into the text after current line.
- search text with /string for string search forward of ?string for backward, navigate search with n for next or N for opposite. :.= for line number of current display at bottom, := total line numbers, ^g for both.

## learning objectives
explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is vi: UNIX text visual editor 
Who is Bill Joy: computer engineer and venture capitalist. vreated vi text editor and c shell for Unix systems.
How to start and exit vi: start with vi filename in command line (-r option to recover if sys crashed) exit with :x or with :q! to not save changes and exit
What are the command and insert modes, and how to switch from one to the other: command mode in which typing edits the file, the command i, transfer to insert mode in which you can insert what you type, and can be exited into command mode with Esc
How to edit text: i command to get to insert mode then type o to start from next line 0 from previous and a to insert after cursor
How to cut and paste lines: cut with d and paste with p
How to search forward and backward: search forward with /string or backward with ?string, navigate with n and N.
How to undo  with u
How to quit vi, with :q if no changes made.:x or :wq, :q! to not save and quit and :w to save and not quit.

## requirements
All tasks must be done inside the sandbox Ubuntu 20.04
Your sandbox must be available at the end of this project - the Checker will access to it just after the deadline to run the correction!
The answer of a task must be in a specific file
Each answer file must contain only the command to execute in Emacs for solving the task. Example: “What is the command to quit without saving changes?” -> the file should contain only :q!
