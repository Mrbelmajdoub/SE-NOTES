###alx se program cheatsheet
- Time management
1. time management for software engineers
- monthly sprint(task allocation)
- task deconposition (each 3 days at most, track, time taken, anddiscuss estimate correctness on next sprint to improve eatimation)
- priortization (rank every task in interval of 10, by visualizing dependency and priority, so you leave space to insert tasks and
- organize tasks by time blocking time you won't be able to work on this task, then fill empty spaces by tasks starting by the lower dependency and leave some buffer time.)
- reflect at end of sprint.
2. 5 tips
-we can be productive for 5-6 hours a day at most, don't try to be productive 24 hours or use all 8 hours a day, it diminishes productivity.
- time boxing, giving tight deadlines for tasks to use (parkinson's law) productiely
- pomodoro technique, 25 min focus 5 min break, give the 25 min goals to use parkinson's law and push forward.
-intentional productive breaks (don't give a single worry or though to the tasks) to reset and recover. the 5 min of pomodoro and take longer one llike 1 hour for a walk to refresh.
- set clear hours when you are working and where you are not. the better these boundries are the more we stick to them, intentional no work time so you don't think or worry about work on them.
- have multiple possible tasks, so if one is stack work on the other while you brain process the other in the background.

3. developer time management, manage time as money, tell it what you are gonna do with it. i am spending this much on this etc.
- using pomodoro time blocking sprints for specific tasks through the day.
- be intentional about your progress, training progress.when you learn C#, create 2 to 5 practice projects, then incorporate into larger project (it might feel slow you down) the intentionality push you through it.
- budget the time for study. also instead of giving like 8 hours or 7 days or specific time to learn something, select 4 hours a week or 1 hour day, every time the focus time come it accummulate.
- when you discover a now thing you need to learn or a new technique, don't get distracted. put it on a list and rank its priority.
- spending time intentionaly, gives better results on the long term.
4. how i manage my time as software engineer
- capture idea into a list, no matter importance
- clarify and organize, make buckets (similar task), 
- engage (choose tasks for the day), aim high and go easy on yourself
- reviw weekly, what to keep, prioritize and what to discard.
5. hack your calendar (concepts)
- time once week to plan next week and a day for next day.them time block on calendar. tasks less than 5 min must be done right away as it will over fill the calendar and be conterproductive
 - 1 offload info outside brain for clarity to focus on high level thinking using a second bain. you could use notion, etc
- 2 time blocking, intentionaly spending time. fixed event, same time. flexible events, need specific timeframe but not fixed time. ad-hoc events, unplanned events of high priority. non essential event, sit on inbox, as filler.
- 3 parkinson law, fill up small gap on time blocking tasks to get a future goal done. or take from inbox
> if a task is taking longoer. stop reschedule the remaining of that task into another time, and get it done there. never cross the allocated time, split it, don't allow yourself the floxibility to go beyond the time.
- 4 borderless scheduling, gtd by using every minute, a task need more waiting fill the time with other task, don't build borders that prevents that.
- 5 zero based scheduly, all time it filled in calendar intentionaly.even leasure time and sleep. makes full use of parkinsons law. let a percentage of time go for freedom. but the important thing is intentional.
- 6 reward driven organization. put what you least enjoy before what you enjow most. boring task rewarded by exiting tasks right after.
6 benefits of time tracking
- rise, rescue time, timely etc. find the time theaf
- batch distraction for later time, don't disrupt focus
-conscious of time spending
- quite multitasking
- ovoid burnout and overworking
- sense of achievement
- weekly review
7 time management apps
- evernotes
- quire
- toggl track
- freedom
- mylifeorganized MLO
- asana
- notion
8 organize busy schedule (student edition)
- delegation, hell yeah or no. ( not suitable for students! so the following are better
- 1 know how much time it takes for the tasks, specialy the usual ones, time it.
- 2 you need calender and a paper, or notes.
- 3 1, capture new tasks on the spot. 2 next morning, you plan. 3 schedule
-4 must be flexible, easy to restart, has to reduce stress (offload into paper), prioritize the tasks,
9 plan the week, the bullet journal,(part to do list part journal) track the past, order the present, design the future
- 1 take a mental inventory (ex on fridays order them) best way to deal with decision fatigue is to get some distance from the choices and their weight on you. write it all down, thats how, then consider each tasks individually
- 2 time blocking (if overwhelmed) it adds structure and urgency

-3 morning reflecton, why you are doing each of the tasks for the day
-4 evening reflection, unwind and unburden the mind, why done it, why a priority ... . makes you feel the day is complete, uncompleted tasks moved to another day,
-5 celebrate. trains you to identify positive moments, which allows you to discover and enjoy more of them.

10 establishing work life balance
 - natural resources: Time, energy, attention( cherich them dearly and give them intentionaly). these go along together in productivity. time is relative to the entity experiencing it, spending time on A means postponing B. Attention is relative, as what you feed your attention becomes the center of your attention. Energy is dynamic, can neither be created or destroyed, but can only be transferred from A to B. (so in multitasking the energy the spread and lost through the spread).
- so much focus can create blindness to other things. learn to switch between helecopter view and grass up view. by mastery the three resources, you will be able to establish focus and know how  and when to zoom out.
- there is room for passion in compassion, so be compassionate.you can't do something (great) bigger than yourself by yourself. another can give you there is an incregible grass land beside you, that your helicopter view simply has not covered. they can be you best friend, parents, like a lightning rod. gratitute helps you remember what tends to work for you. a problem showing up means there is a solution out there.
- list of tasks over a period and keep in mind how would that affect the bigger picture.
- don't carry the weight of the whole responsability on your shoulders, don't do great things alone, share it with others. let others know.


- curiosity takes you far, poeple are more interested giving you knowledge of what they learned that giving you money. asking money can give you advice, but asking advice can give you money and shows your competence.
- KPI's, personal KPIs, how does my day feed into them. KPIs for projects etc. they keep things from straying. they are how you test the progress and relativity, they help with the grass up view.

11 manage time and conquer imposter syndrom
- highlight the routines and habits that help you stay focused, sleep properly, planning, meditation, music, exercising, praying, self-check in and goal visualization, reading, eating healthy ...
- the ones holding you back: rocrastination, irregular sleeping, social media, social pressure, overthinking.
- developping (transform an existing habit into) positive habitsfor remote learning
definition: choise we delibrately make at some point, and then stop thinking about, but continue doing, often every day.
concept and structure of habits: cue (kicks into automatic mode telling it witch habit to use) then routine (physical, mental emotional response ) reward (prise physical or mental or emotional state (ex escape, stress, distraction)). you can't change cue or reward, only habit can change to achieve that reward
goal: to identify a habit to change and find an alternative routine that retains the same cue and reward
step 1 identifying the habit(write it): be precise and specific, visualize a certain behavior in time and space. ex instead of "i procrastinate" say " i get distracted on the phone a lot".

step 2: identify (draw) the cue, routine, and reward , ex 1 cue: i am stressed. 2 routine : i take the phone to scroll instagram 3 prize: i get distracted and i lower the stress.
step 3: put this habit into action! write it in this format (the habit = cue + routine + reward)
- understanding inposter syndrome :
identify your pessimism Pirates (those destructive thoughts that make you procrastinate,overthink, feeling distressed and overwhelmed) write it down (be as specific as possible starting with "i think" for example "i think my peers are better than me and know more than me in Python")
formulate your empower-me mantras (write it): empowering affirmations that fight against the pessimism Pirates (ones that counter the pirates)
start by reading your pessimism pirate and write the mantras down like the following: pirate : (i think my peers are better than me and know more than me) mantra : (i am able to get the knowledge i need and to apply it).

- task prioritization and project effeciency
#### 2 Project and coding effeciency tutorial
read learning objectives first. experiment while reading and project it. make a time limit for the reading and tasks.

decide the priority tasks for your day (realisticly 3) 

- navigating projects:
Check Learning Objectives.
Review foundational concepts.
Utilize available resources.
Explore YouTube tutorials for visual learning.

- offline documentation: [python] (https://savanna.alxafrica.com/rltoken/VswCqM2NMdqkKXwm8JfeVg), [C++ reference] (https://savanna.alxafrica.com/rltoken/mNO00trdSWL1axXhank5NA), etc (Ruby Documentation - PHP Manual - Swift Documentation - React Documentation - Angular Documentation - Django Documentation)

###The framework

0.Read everything (project prerequisites, man pages, documentation, books, and articles.) and try all examples on docs
1. think,l, make sure all is understood, then pause, rest, think of a solution. **only* code to translate your finished solution into a code. it will be better to break downbthe problem in smaller easier ones. and it help to first rephrase the problem, "what am i try to accomplish here?", then go through different examples, "with this input, parameter,  etc, i should output, return, etc,"  then "what edge cases i have to consider here" then focus on base case "what should my algorithm be?" when found run it on different examples on whiteboard or paper to see if it meets expectation, then find changes for edge cases to work. *do not guess* solutions even if they work, you need to understand all concepts, thats how you devlop critical thinking and think like an engineer. *use paper or whiteboard** untill the solution is confirmed to maintain focus and keep mind active.
2. think more + whiteboard,  write or draw the problem, it is easier to visualize l. think more and patiently if solution is not found yet, made sure resources are understood.
3. Ask why? whether the code runs or not, make sure to know why is that whithout looking at the error message. understand concepts, vocabulary,  tools and why a question exists. foe example if it is bit manipulation, then Why do you think this is important? Is it important? Why binary? Where do bits play a role? How is it connected to the machine, memory, bytes and values of types?
**Never blindly work on tasks without first understanding why it is important to spend time on the topic of the day and how it plays a role in the system or comprehension of CS. Understanding the big picture is very important to your education and future career.**

4. read the error message if you still don't understand
5. google it if problem is still not found. google only specific (error message, specific question or concept etc), nover trust the internet as it is often wrong or incomplete, so challenge every assumption. don't look at poeples code and don't copy past from internet
6. google with more context
7. ask a peer and more peers
8. ask chatgpt , use it for learning (simpler explanation, more additional more detailed question, find bug), not for faster more effective solution. nover copy paste its code, understand it, close window, code it yourself. at end of project ask it for “I am a software engineering student and I had to create a function that {describe the function} This is my code {paste your code here>}. Do you see a way to improve it? If so, can you explain how and why?”.

{Always remember one thing: your goal is not to become great students. Your goal is to become great software engineers, because no one wants to hire students.}

###practical use:
-monthly sprint in documentation
- use pomodoro and be intentional about break (mind free from task)
- if you get stack in one problem, switch. the brain will process it in the backgroung
- list distraction knowledge in a list to process later
- use projects to experiment and use your learning
- daily, capture, clarify and organize, engage. then weekly review
- if a task is taking longer. stop reschedule the remaining of that task into another time, and get it done there. never cross the allocated time, split it, don't allow yourself the floxibility to go beyond the time.
- later to do (plan the week, the bullet journal,(part to do list part journal) track the past, order the present, design the future)
- my natural resources(use them intentionaly): 1. time: relative, spending in A means postponing B 2. attention: relative, what you spend attention on become the center of your attention. 3. enerdy is dynamic, it neither be created or destroyed, just transfered from A to B.
- by mastering these natural resources, you will master focus, learning focus help switching zoom, as if you zoom in too much you will be blinded from other thing, so to have hilicopter view and grass up view and switching them is mastery of focus.
- great things are done together, there might be a big grass land just beside yours, but you missed it, another may not. for a big picture, make the list of tasks over a long time be toward that direction.
- curiosity takes you far, if you ask for money you get advice, if you ask for knowledge you might get money. 
- highlight habits and routines that help you focus them the ones holding you back. then
- developping (transform an existing habit into) a positive habit
