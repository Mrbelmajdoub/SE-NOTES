### struggling with the sandbox? docker and WSL on local host
ways to aquiring linux ubuntu 20.04 environment in case host OS in not one:
- dual booting
- via WLS (recommended)
- virtual machine
- linux docker containers (recomended) (flexible, lightweight and ease of use) (isolation)
docker containerize OS, to package code and dependencies into isolated containers (light, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run an upplication (code, runtime, sys tools,sys lib, and setting)
potable, can be used on any machine with docker installed, reproducibility. isolation, effeciency, scalability.
docker is used to build docker images, them run containers (docker run) ten manage containers (docker ps, docker stop, docker start), networking containers (docker network create), storing docker images (docker push, docker pull).

is hardware and software you use to write code
Understanding important concepts about Docker
Docker images: A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings.
Docker containers: A Docker container is a runnable instance of a Docker image. It includes the application code and all of its dependencies, but it runs isolated from other containers on the same host.
Dockerfile: A Dockerfile is a text file that contains the instructions for building a custom Docker image. It tells Docker what software to install, what configuration settings to use, and so on.
Docker Hub: Docker Hub is a public registry of Docker images. It allows you to find and share images with other users.
Docker Compose: Docker Compose is a tool that allows you to define and run multi-container Docker applications. It makes it easy to manage complex applications that require multiple containers.
Important Docker Commands
docker pull - This command is used to pull a Docker ubuntu image from a registry.
docker run - creates and starts a Docker container from an image
docker start - is used for containers that have been previously created but are currently stopped. If you want to create and start a new container in a single step, you can use the docker run command.
docker exec - runs a command in a running Docker container.
docker stop - stops a running Docker container.
docker ps -a - This command is used to list all of the Docker containers, including those that are not running.
docker kill - This command is used to forcefully stop a Docker container.
docker rm - This command is used to remove a Docker container.
docker images - This command is used to list all of the Docker images that are stored on your machine.
docker search - This command is used to search for Docker images in a registry.
docker inspect - This command is used to get detailed information about a Docker container or image.
docker logs - This command is used to view the logs for a Docker container.
docker commit - This command is used to create a new Docker image from an existing container.
docker push - This command is used to push a Docker image to a registry.
docker tag - This command is used to tag a Docker image with a new name or identifier.
docker build - This command is used to build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
docker compose - This command is used to run a Docker application that is defined in a Docker Compose file.
Building Ubuntu 20.04 Docker Image for alx projects
First-Time Setup
- docker pull ubuntu:20.04 - Pull the ubuntu 20.04 image from docker hub
docker run -it --name my-ubuntu-container ubuntu:20.04 - This command is used to run a Docker ubuntu 20.04 container.
How to Use the Container Again
docker start my-ubuntu-container - starting the container named “my-ubuntu-container” that was created from the Ubuntu 20.04 image.
docker exec -it my-ubuntu-container /bin/bash - executes the /bin/bash command inside the my-ubuntu-container container in interactive mode.
docker stop my-ubuntu-container - When you are done and want to stop the “my-ubuntu-container” container, use the following command.
You can access Windows files from WSL. To do this, use the /mnt/c directory. For example, to access the C:\Windows directory, you would use the /mnt/c/Windows directory.
You can run Windows applications from WSL. To do this, use the wsl –run command. For example, to run the notepad.exe application, you would use the wsl –run notepad.exe command.
### source code management
allows organization of code iteretions chronologically and version it for an application. allows teams of very diverse sizes to work together on the same application simultaneously. common terms are: 
A project will be called repository, it’s representing the index/the filesystem root of your project.
Developers might create branches of the codebase, that they will iterate on separately to other developers. For instance, a branch can be meant to be used for a given feature, or a given bug fix. One can create however many branches they need.
Once a branch is ready for it (it’s been tested, peer-reviewed, etc.), it can be merged back to the main branch. The main branch may be called differently: in Git it’s called master , in SVN it’s called trunk.
While coding on their branch, developers are meant to work in small, atomic iterations, called commits. All commits have a commit message describing in one sentence what’s in there.
All commits together are called the history , and it’s a big deal to write meaningful commits and commit messages in order to keep the project’s history clean at a glance, to understand what has been going on and who did what.
Some people might be modifying the same pieces on the codebase on different branches, and this could create conflicts when one merges those branches together. Some of those conflicts can obviously only be fixed by a human, and each system has a different way to manage merge conflicts.
some systems of source code management: sourcesafe, cvs, svn, git, mercurial.
git is by design usable without a central repository, but mot many use it that way, usually a central git server is used by a whole team.
commit operation is local, push to publish it, you would want to pull often is others are working on the same branch as you. each performs a merge between code you didn't have and code you recently commited. so in order to push, git sometimes demand that you pull first. so you can merge on computer and take care of potontial conflicts.
sometimes you would want to keep a file seperate from a commit, so git has an intox in which you add modified files to include in the next commit.
how to configure the remote servers local repo is talking to? as many as you need, main one typicaly named origin(setup when cloning project from a remote location in the first place). as many branches as well named as you wish, default one called master.

How to configure the remote servers your local repository is talking to? They’re called remotes , and you can configure however many you need. The main one is typically named origin (that’s the name that is setup by default when you clone a project from a remote location in the first place). You can also configure however many branches you need, and name them as you please, and the default one is usually called master.
Some UI tools for Git exist, but Git is able to do so many things, that they don’t represent the magnitude of cases for which you need Git. You really want to learn to use it with the command line. Here are some commands:

$ git clone url_of_your_remote_repository   # Clone a repository from a remote repository  
$ git add file1 file2    # will add those two files to the index if they were modified  
$ git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"   # will commit those two files (locally)  
$ git add .   # will add all of the modified files to the index at once  
$ git commit -m "Other meaningful commit message"   # will commit all of those files together  
$ git push origin master   # send all commit to the remote server
Now, let’d do this again, but by on a branch:

$ git branch my_feature   # Creating the branch  
$ git checkout my_feature   # Changing the codebase so that we're on that branch now  
$ git checkout -b my_feature   # This does the two previous operations in one ;)  
$ git add file1 file2  
$ git commit -m "Meaningful commit message"   # We didn't just commit this on the master branch like last time, but on the my_feature one  
$ git add .  
$ git commit -m "Other meaningful commit message"  
$ git push origin my_feature   # Notice: we're not pushing master anymore, you just create a new remote branch
Next time you want to work on that branch, you should probably do this first:

$ git checkout my_feature   # Just making sure you're currently on the right branch!  
$ git pull origin my_feature   # Pulling what your coworkers have done so far.  
And when you’re done with the whole feature and want to merge it to master:

$ git checkout master  
$ git merge my_feature  
One other pretty neat thing: if you have a non-Git directory in your computer, and you want to turn it into a Git repository, it’s that easy:

$ git init   # You're done!  
$ git remote add origin url_of_your_git_server   # So that you can push your code somewhere.  
When you’re in a Git repository, and want to know which files are modified but not in the index, and those that are modified and are in the index, you can run:

$ git status  
Git provides many more abilities, such as rewriting pieces of the history of the project if you feel the commits were not meaningful enough, displaying the history in visually meaningful ways, …

For instance, you should run this right now, and see how a complex history can be viewed really nicely:

$ git clone [https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips.git](https://github.com/loverajoel/jstips.git)   # You will need a GitHub account for this to work  
$ cd jstips   # changing your directory into the one you just downloaded  
$ git log --graph --pretty=tformat:'%Cred%h%Creset -%C(yellow)%d%Creset %s %Cgreen(%an %cr)%Creset' --abbrev-commit --date=relative  

- git is everything covered to this point while github provides git repo server, web UI, extra features (managing team and accesses ...), Forks ( duplicate to your own but reembers where it forked from) to allow push into your own as to others is not allowed., pull requests ( is request to pull mster branch and merge if it is suitable for the main produc, after the one in charge of master review your request)

Learn git branching

### right-engineering, right-documenting
Assume that a developer who knows nothing about the decisions you made on your project, and what you were trying to do, will take it over and need to understand it. What can you do today to help them get up to speed efficiently? Here’s the killer motivation: more often than not, that developer is actually you, months from now, after working on many other projects and forgetting all about the decisions you had made. Just like every developer, you will reach that moment where you hate your past self for not having documented better. You can consider anything that helps that future developer understand your decisions and get into your code is an item of documentation, such as:

The most obvious: architectural documentation , documenting the most high-level choices you made. It shouldn’t necessarily contain any code, but should simply explain in the most concise and digestible way possible some of the choices that will allow to understand how the code is organized.
Comments are your best way to document what the code is doing at a narrower level:
Comments to describe your functions (even more so if your code is meant to be reused by other people): you may want to look into the syntaxes that are conventional in the language you’re using. There might be documentation generators using the comments if they’re input properly.
Comments inside functions: they should be short and descriptive enough that when a developer browses through the code reading only those comments, they understand what each step is, and the whole sequence of what happens.

Names of functions and variables should represent what they’re about without ambiguity. If it would be too long to explain for the size of a variable name, add a comment before the line where you created it, to explain what it is (the next developer, not understanding what it is, will naturally try to find where it was created to try to figure out where it comes from).
Indentation  of the code must be properly achieved, so that if the comment and name functions are not explicit enough for what the developer needs to know, they can dive into the code in the most readable way possible.
The Git commit messages , so that a developer who is trying to figure out the chronology of events will at a glance.
Always put a README.md file in your project. It’s even more relevant as you’ll push your projects on GitHub, since that’s what GitHub displays on your project’s homepage. A README.md file is like the about page of your project, introducing newcomers to what it’s about, how to set it up, its licence information, the process people must follow to contribute to it, … To be clear: you don’t have to have a full README file for every little project you work on, but you should definitely have one for longer projects.

Symptoms and risks of over-documenting
Don’t document the tools you use. Rule of thumb: if some information that is in the documentation is findable online, it doesn’t belong in your documentation.
Getting into the project is hard, because it takes more than 10 minutes to read the documentation to get started.
It takes more than 30 seconds / 1 minute to search for the right specific information about anything, even when knowing where to look.
Making a change is complex, because you have to ensure that the various places where things are documented are up to date. Resulting risks could be:

people avoid making changes so that they don’t have to worry about finding what to update in the documentation (the thing that Apple feared);

because it’s too complex, people don’t bother updating the documentation, or fail to change something relevant in the documentation, which gradually turns outdated.


Symptoms and risks of under-documenting
Take some time to try and pretend wiping your brain and knowledge about the project, and having to learn everything from scratch about how it’s made. Write your documentation for the person you are when you do that.
Even great code, when uncommented, looks like code spaghetti when you look at it first, and it’s very hard and time-consuming to take one’s first steps into it.
If you make your code open-source, no one will take the time to understand your code if it’s not well-documented, and what could have been a great open-source project will stall before even existing.
That one day of the year when you’re home with the flu, and your brain doesn’t work right, you’re going to be very happy that when your coworker contacts you with a blocking issue and asks you how the heck this gets fixed, you’re able to just reply “RTFM”, turn Netflix off, and doze off a bit.
Also, in a larger company where it’s likely that several teams might need to build similar things, not documenting or communicating about what you’re building could mean that someone will redo it entirely from scratch while they could simply have used what you built. The opposite may happen: you suddenly realize that the thing you’ve been working on had already been done by someone else who never told anyone.

- right engineering
Gauging a level of engineering has a lot to do with planning for the future, avoiding to over-complicate things, and also sometimes with levels of abstraction.

Let’s take a step back with a nice physical-world allegory.

Let’s say that you are trying to accomplish a task, which is: sending 10 tennis balls into a basket. Here are two extreme possibilities to handle the issue:

either you’re doing it in the most naive way, grab a tennis ball, throw it in the basket, start over 9 times with the other balls.
or, you’re building a small catapult, smart enough that when you push a button, it will grab the first ball by itself, throw it exactly right, grab the second one, etc, with no need for you to intervene. The next day, you’re being told that you have to throw 10 golf balls. If you took the first path, that’s simple enough: grab the first golf ball, throw it, repeat. But if you used the catapult, you’re at a loss: your catapult was built for balls that weigh the same as a tennis ball, not a golf ball. You must reconstruct a new catapult from scratch. By abstracting how an object is thrown as much as you could, without consideration with things that were likely to need to be done in the future, you’ve over-engineered your system with your smart catapult, and now it’s unusable.
The next day, you’re being told that you now have to throw 100 tennis balls, and 100 golf balls. If you’ve been a catapult builder, you’re happy: give all of those to both your catapults, and they’ll manage everything for you. If you’ve been a thrower, you must be freaking out: because you haven’t tried to abstract how an object gets thrown, and therefore have under engineered your system, you now have to do everything in a way that is impractical.

Once you are very familiar with a technology, you will tend to over engineer things more, because one feels smart doing that, and throwing 10 tennis balls sounds annoying. Advanced developers tend to come up with systems that are so elegant for their use case, that it will be very hard to change it for the future use cases. To make the right decision about level of engineering, there is a tradeoff to find about keeping things simple so that they keep flexible, and making things engineered enough that are well-maintainable.

"If you’re about to take a hundred lines to write what you could in ten, stop and ask yourself this: what the fuck?"
The best way to avoid overengineering is just don’t design too far into the future. if that developer really did know he’d need such a system in the future, it would be a mistake to design the code in such a way that the system couldn’t be added later. It doesn’t need to be there now, but you’d be underengineering if you made it impossible to add it later.Good design is design that leads to simplicity in implementation and maintenance, and makes it easy to understand the code. Overengineered design is design that leads to difficulty in implementation, makes maintenance a nightmare, and turns otherwise simple code into a twisty maze of complexity. It’s not nearly as common as underengineering, but it’s still important to watch out for.

### Authenticating Git

-(best way) SSH Key
Generate an SSH Key
Open a terminal window.
Generate a new SSH key with the following command:
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519
Enter a passphrase for your key when prompted. The passphrase is optional.
Press Enter to accept the default file location for your key.
Your SSH key has now been generated. The public key is stored in the file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub and the private key is stored in the file ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.

Add Your SSH Key to GitHub
Go to your GitHub profile settings.
Click the SSH and GPG keys tab.
Click the New SSH key button.
Paste the contents of your public key file (~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) into the Key field.
Click the Add SSH key button.
GitHub SSH key authentication is a method of authentication that uses SSH keys to verify your identity. SSH keys are a cryptographic key pair that consists of a public key and a private key. The public key is shared with others, while the private key is kept secret.

To use SSH key authentication with GitHub, you will need to generate an SSH key pair and add the public key to your GitHub account. Once you have done this, you can use the private key to authenticate to GitHub and access your repositories.

How to Set and Use SSH Keys
Generate an SSH key. If you don’t already have one, you can generate an SSH key using the following command:
   ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Add your SSH key to GitHub. Go to your GitHub account settings and click the SSH and GPG keys tab. Click the New SSH key button and paste the contents of your public key file (~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub) into the Key field. Click the Add SSH key button.
Clone a GitHub repository using SSH. To clone a GitHub repository using SSH, use the following command:
   git clone git@github.com:username/repository.git
Replace username with your GitHub username and repository with the name of the repository you want to clone.

Push changes to a GitHub repository using SSH. To push changes to a GitHub repository using SSH, use the following command:
   git push git@github.com:username/repository.git
Replace username with your GitHub username and repository with the name of the repository you want to push to.
-Personal Access Token
A personal access token (PAT) is a unique string that can be used to authenticate to GitHub on your behalf. PATs can be created with different permissions and scopes, so you can control what actions they can perform. They can also be used to grant access to your repositories to third-party apps and services.

Steps to Create a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)
Go to your GitHub account settings and click the Personal Access Tokens tab.
Click the Generate new token button.
Enter a name and description for your PAT.
Select the permissions and scopes that you want your PAT to have.
Click the Generate token button.
Your PAT will be displayed in a text box. Copy and store your PAT in a secure location. You will need this PAT to authenticate to GitHub using the command line or third-party apps and services.

How to Clone a Repository Using a Personal Access Token (PAT)
Open a terminal window.
Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
Clone the repository using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git --token <pat>
Replace <username> with your GitHub username, <repository> with the name of the repository you want to clone, and <pat> with your PAT.

For example, to clone the my-repo-001 repository owned by the user betascribbles, you would use the following command:

git clone https://github.com/betascribbles/my-repo-001.git --token <pat>
Once the repository has been cloned, you can navigate to it using the cd command and start working on the code.


How to Push Changes to a Repository Using a PAT
Open a terminal window.
Navigate to the directory where you want to push the changes from.
Stage the changes that you want to push using the git add command.
Commit the changes using the git commit command.
Push the changes to the remote repository using the following command:
   git push https://github.com/<username>/<repository>.git --token <pat>
Replace <username> with your GitHub username, <repository> with the name of the repository you want to push to, and <pat> with your PAT.

For example, to push the changes to the my-repo-001 repository owned by the user betascribbles, you would use the following command:

git push https://github.com/betascribbles/my-repo-001.git --token <pat>

### git and github cheat sheet, all in less than 30 seconds
create repo (boom in github), (local) mkdir boom, cd boom, echo boom > README.md, git init, git add ., git commit -m "add : README file", git branch -M main, git remote ad origin git@github.com/username/boom.git.

## resources
### resources to learn git
-set up git
download git, (download GUI if you want)(Termux> apt install git , then type y when prompted).
set up username: git config --global user.name "Mona Lisa"
confirm with $ git config --global user.name
set usename for single repo, go inside dir of repo then git config user.name "Mona Lisa", to confirm $ git config user.name
to set email adress (user.email, instead of user.name)
- authenticate git 
https, ssh
### about READMEs
README files typically include information on:

What the project does
Why the project is useful
How users can get started with the project
Where users can get help with your project
Who maintains and contributes to the project

github automatically generates table of contents based on section headings, you can directly  link to any section that has heading.
relative links and image paths can be defined relative to current file, example, README in root, to link to docs/index.md (docs in root) do this: [index of this project](docs/index.md), links starting with /  will be absolute paths (from root), link text must be in single line. (relative links are recomended as absolote links may not work on clones of repo.

-A README should contain only the necessary information for developers to get started using and contributing to your project. Longer documentation is best suited for wikis.
We use our open-source Markup library to convert different formats into HTML, so you can choose to write in Markdown or any other supported format.

You can use Markdown to add rendered math expressions, diagrams, maps, and 3D models to your wiki.
### How to write a git commit message
-sample :
$ git log --oneline -5 --author pwebb --before "Sat Aug 30 2014"

5ba3db6 Fix failing CompositePropertySourceTests
84564a0 Rework @PropertySource early parsing logic

ac8326d Polish mockito usage

- git log, But a well-cared for log is a beautiful and useful thing. git blame, revert, rebase, log, shortlog and other subcommands come to life.In order to create a useful revision history, teams should first agree on a commit message convention that defines at least the following three things:

Style. Markup syntax, wrap margins, grammar, capitalization, punctuation. Spell these things out, remove the guesswork, and make it all as simple as possible. The end result will be a remarkably consistent log that’s not only a pleasure to read but that actually does get read on a regular basis.

Content. What kind of information should the body of the commit message (if any) contain? What should it not contain?

Metadata. How should issue tracking IDs, pull request numbers, etc. be referenced?
- The seven rules of a great Git commit message
Keep in mind: This has all been said before.
Separate subject from body with a blank line
Limit the subject line to 50 characters
Capitalize the subject line
Do not end the subject line with a period
Use the imperative mood in the subject line ex (If applied, this commit will) **refactor subsystem X for readability**
Wrap the body at 72 characters
Use the body to explain what and why vs. how

## requirements
General
A README.md file at the root of the alx-pre_course repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x01-git), describing what this project is about
Do not use GitHub’s web UI, but the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You won’t be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
Your answer files should only contain the command, and nothing else
## More Info
Basic usage
At the end of this project you should be able to reproduce and understand these command lines:

$ git clone <repo>
$ touch test
$ git add test
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push origin main

##tasks:
0. Create and setup your Git and GitHub account
mandatory
Score: 100.0% (Checks completed: 100.0%)
Step 0 - Create an account on GitHub [if you do not have one already]
You will need a GitHub account for all your projects at ALX. If you do not already have a github.com account, you can create an account for free here

Step 1 - Create a Personal Access Token on Github
To have access to your repositories and authenticate yourself, you need to create a Personal Access Token on Github.

You can follow this tutorial to create a token.

Once it’s created, you should have a token that looks like this:



Step 2 - Update your profile on the Intranet
Update your Intranet profile by adding your Github username here

If it’s not done the Checker won’t be able to correct your work



Step 3 - Create your first repository
Using the graphic interface on the github website, create your first repository.

Name: alx-zero_day
Description: I'm now a ALX Student, this is my first repository as a full-stack engineer
Public repo
No README, .gitignore, or license


Step 4 - Open the sandbox
On the intranet, just under the task, click on the button  and run to start the machine.

Once the container is started, click on  to open a shell where you can start work from.

Step 5 - Clone your repository
On the webterm of the sandbox, do the following:

Clone your repository
root@896cf839cf9a:/# git clone https://{YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN}@github.com/{YOUR_USERNAME}/alx-zero_day.git                  
Cloning into 'alx-zero_day'...
warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository.       
Replace {YOUR_PERSONAL_TOKEN} with your token from step 1

Replace {YOUR_USERNAME} with your username from step 0 and 1

Pro-Tip: On windows, use CTRL + A + V to paste in the web terminal

Step 6 - Create the README.md and push the modifications
Navigate to this new directory. Tips
root@896cf839cf9a:/# cd alx-zero_day/
root@896cf839cf9a:/alx-zero_day#
Create the file README.md with the content My first readme. Tips
root@896cf839cf9a:/alx-zero_day# echo 'My first readme' > README.md

Good job!

You pushed your first file in your first repository of the first task of your first ALX School project.

You can now check your repository on GitHub to see if everything is good.







- 3. needed git branch, git status, git checkout, git merge, to resolve conflics do git status and look for both modified, then access it and leave one version only, then git add then commit and push. file .gitignore ignores any patterns indicated in any line, uses wildcards and ! reverse the pattern.
