# introduction to mindsets (grit and growth mindset)
What is grit?:  passion and persevearence for long term goals, stamina ( live as a marathon, not a sprint)
What evidence is there that grit is important? (Can you briefly describe one study that Duckworth mentions?) (What groups were examined, what was the treatment they received, and what was the result?): military trainees, teachers, students etc, were predicted on they success i a year later, and one variable that stack with success is perseverence and grit.
What is growth mindset?: best idea to grow grit, that the ability to learn is not fixed but can be changed through effort. NOT YET, not failure grade but NOT YET
What is fixed mindset?: their inteligent has been up to challenge and they failed, they have been stuck at NOW, next they cheat and looked for worse students, and run from deficculty
How do brains behave when they are in fixed vs. growth mindset?: no activity at fixed mindset, but with growth mindset engage deeply and process the error and learn from it and then correct it.
What evidence is there that growth mindset is important? You should be able to describe 1 study at a high level: What was the group that was studied? What was the “treatment” (or variable that the different participants received)? What was the result of that study? (again, high level, no need for small details). student taught growth mindset and the growth mindset have shown more perseverence.
