###white boarding
understanding the laguage and frameworks are just tools, they won't teach you problem solving, you devlop it when you practice a lot of coding questions.
new devlopers don't know how to turn their thoughts into code even while understanding the syntax or logic. here are steps of how programmers effectively approach a coding problem.
- step 1: understand and analyze the problem
complelety read the question to small details, write input and output, then while working on the problem ask, is problem fully understood? are you able to explain it to someone else? what and how many inputs are required? what output must came out of them? do you need to separate out some modules or parts of the problem? do you have enough info to solve the question?
- step 2: Go through the sample data and examples throughly
take some sample input and analyze output. can help to determine the output range and cases that can be handled by the code. try complex and bigger output, then edge cases. consider output if there is no input or invalid input. instead of fearing the problem, break it down into smaller chunks and try to solve each. bellow are some steps for complex coding questions
> make a flow chart for the problem at hand: devide int osubproblems and chunks, solve subs by independent functionsm connect solutions of subs by calling them in the required order, or as necessary. whenever possible use classes and objects while handling questions
- step 4: write pseudocode, make a flowchart
defines structure and logic of code. write every line and step
- step 5: replace pseudocode with real code in the language you are working on. 
keep in mind the point where you started, where you are right now, what is you destination (end result)
- step 6: simplify and optimize you code;
find better or alternate solutions. after optimizing ask these questions . Does this code run for every possible input including the edge cases.
Is there an alternate solution for the same problem?
Is the code efficient? Can it be more efficient or can the performance be improved?
How else can you make the code more readable?
Are there any more extra steps or functions you can take out?
Is there any repetition in your code? Take it out.
###flowcharts
diagram to visually represent a workflow or process using a set of symbols or icons to denote different actions/decisions/steps within the process wiht arrows showing the direction of the flow. it provides another approach and understanding to a workflow
- flowchart symbols: ISO 5807 symbol set
| symbol | name | description|
|--------|------|------------|
|arrow   | flowline| shows the order, comes from a symbol to another|
|rectangle|process| process, action, step, or operation, text is usually a verb|
