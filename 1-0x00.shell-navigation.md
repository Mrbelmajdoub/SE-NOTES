# 0x00. Shell, navigation

## learning objectives:
-explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
General
How to navigate in an Unix system: cd to navigate pwd
How to list files and directories: ls and -a for hidden display
How to display the content of a file: using less command if command file shows it is a text file
How to create a file or directory: mkdir for directory . for file vi, emacs, or nano to open editor and save after, or touch to create or update timestamp.
How to remove a file or directory: rm
How to move or copy a file or directory: mv and cp, for directories add option -r or -R.
## requirements (not as important in this one)
All tasks must be done inside the sandbox Ubuntu 20.04
Your sandbox must be available at the end of this project - the Checker will access to it at midnight for running the correction!

### linux navigation
- file system organization: is a hierarchical directory structure.first directory in the file system is called the root directory. while Windows splite file system into different trees through drve letters, this concept in not in linux, there is always only a single tree in linux.
- pwd (print working directory) 
if file system tree is a maze, at any given moment we are socated in a single directory, inside , we can see its files and the pathway to its parent directory and pathways to its subdirectories.
the directory we are standing is is called the working directory, to sy its name we use pwd command
when we first log into our linux, the working directory is our home directory, mostly called /home/user_name, but can be anythiing depending on the system administrator.
cd (change (working) directory)
we cd followed by the pathname of the desired working directory.
a pathname is the route we take along the braches of the tree to get to the directory we want, they can be in two different ways, absolute pathmanes begins with the root directory and follows the tree branch by branch until the the path to the desired directory is complete (ex [/usr/bin] root directory is represented by the leading slash "/" in the pathname) (the shell prompt usually setup to display the name of the working directory, or relative pathnames which starts from the working directory and we use "." (dot) and ".." (dot dot), one dot represents the working directory, two dots represent its parent directory (for example from /usr/bin as working directory (cd ..)takes us to parent dir /usr then to go to bin again using relative pathname we use (./bin) the dot means starting from current working directory). in most cases we can omit ./ and directly use next step in relative pathname, in general if we don't specify, the working directory will be assumed.
- ls (list files and directories)
- few shortcuts: - cd followed by nothing takes to our home directotry. - cd ~user_name take to home of specific user. - cd - changes working directory to the previous one
- important facts about file names: if it begins with a period character, it stays hidden, we need to use ls -a to show hidden as well, in home dir, several exists to configure things for the account and costumize environment, some apps do the same. file names in linux are case sensitive "File1" and "file1" are different files. there is no concept of file extension in linux, applications do care about them however. it is better to limit the punctuation characters to period, dash, and underscore, and **do not embed spaces in filenames, represent them using underscore, you will thank yourself later**
### linux - looking around
- ls (list files and directories) can be used in many ways, "/etc /bin" to list other directories together "-l" list in a long format "-a" list all . in long format it shows file permissions (first character indicate type of file, "-" indicate regular file, "d" indicate directory. then a set of read, write, and execute permission of owner then group then everybody else), owner, group, size (in bytes), modification time (date and year show is last modification was over 6 months), and file name.
- less (view text files). handy since many linux configuration files are human readable. follow it by text_file. less displays one page at a time, pageup or b and pagedown or space to move and q to exit. F to go to end of text file, 1G to go to beginning of it. /characters to search forward for the specified characters, n repeat previous search, h display list of less commands and options.
text is one-to-one mapping of characters to numbers, 50 character translates to 50 bytes of data, ASCII (american standart code for information interchange) is a simple encoding scheme that turns text into numeric representation undrestood by computers.
- file (classify a files's content). the kind of data it contains must be determined before viewing by typing name_of_file as argument. it can recognize most types, some viewable as text like ASCII text or bash scripts or HTML document text or postscript document file. some are not texts like JPEG, zip, executables.
- an important concept about commands is that most operate like this "command -options arguments" command is name of command, options are more adjustments to the commands's behavior, arguments is one or more things upton which the command operates.
- in linux there is no secrets, important configuration files are controled by text files and shell scripts.
### linux manipulation
these offer power and flexibility
- cp (copy files and directories), -u (for update, copy only unexisting or newer version) arguments all copied into last argument. -i option for interactive, prompt before overwriting. -R for directory copy recursivle (all branches) into another, or create it if not existing.
- mv (move or rename files and directories) move arguments into last argument. -i for interactive.
- rm (remove files and directories) (deletes), -r option to use on directories.-i interactive prompt on each delete. **rm can inflict terrific damage on system particulary with wildcards, before using it construct with ls instead to test then substitute rm for ls** 
- mkdir (create directories) 
- wildcards: special characters to help specify groups of filenames based on a pattern of characters. * matches any characters, ? matches any single character, [characters] maches any character that is a member of the set characters (there are also POSIX character classes [:alnum:] alphanumeric [:alpha:] alphabetic [:digit:] numeral [:upper:] uppercase alphabetic [:lower:] lowecase alphabetic, [!characters] matches any character that is not member of the set. example [[:upper:]] * starts with upper, * [![:lower:]] any file name not ending with lowercase.

man pwd
man ls
man cd
man less
man touch
man cp
man mv
man rm
man mkdir
man rmdir

## sum
- file system is hierarchical starting from a root directory. pwd (print working (current) directory), cd can change directory through absolut pathname starting from root and starts with /, or relative pathname starting from current dir ./, and can go to previous through .., while the starting ./ can be ommited. if cd is followed by nothing it go to home directory, if by ~username it goes to home dir of specified user, if by - it goes to previous working dir. ls list files and directories, if followed by -a it shows hidden files ( files starting with dot "."), followeed by -l shows long format, in long format it shows file permissions (first character indicate type of file, "-" indicate regular file, "d" indicate directory. then a set of read, write, and execute permission of owner then group then everybody else), owner, group, size (in bytes), modification time (date and year show is last modification was over 6 months), and file name. file names are case sensitive and limit punctuation to ., /, and _ . use underscore instead of embed space in file names
- file shows file type and less display file text if it is viewable as such. less can be controled by b and space for page up and down G for end of file, 1G for beginning of file, /character to search forward and n for repeat previous search, h display complete list of less commands and options and q to quit.
ASCII encode characters into numeric representation for computers, 50 character for 50 bytes.
command (name of command) - options (more adjustments to comand's behaviour) arguments(one or more things upon which the command operates). 
- cp for copy, mv to move or rename (both overwrite into last argument). rm to remove, mkdir to create directory. options -u for update (only unexisting or newer version), -i for interactive, -r for recursive (needed for directories to effect the content as well like subdirectories content etc) -R is forced recursive.
Wildcards laverage patterns, * matches any characters. ? for any single character, [charactes] for a set of characters, POSIX character classes [:alnum:][:alpha:][:digit:][:upper:][:lower:], or [!characters] to match any nonmember character of the set.
**use ls instead of rm first when using wildcard to prevent damaging system**
-rmdir removes empty directory
