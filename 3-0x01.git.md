## concepts
### struggling with the sandbox? docker and WSL on local host
ways to aquiring linux ubuntu 20.04 environment in case host OS in not one:
- dual booting
- via WLS (recommended)
- virtual machine
- linux docker containers (recomended) (flexible, lightweight and ease of use) (isolation)
docker containerize OS, to package code and dependencies into isolated containers (light, standalone, executable packages that include everything needed to run an upplication (code, runtime, sys tools,sys lib, and setting)
potable, can be used on any machine with docker installed, reproducibility. isolation, effeciency, scalability.
docker is used to build docker images, them run containers (docker run) ten manage containers (docker ps, docker stop, docker start), networking containers (docker network create), storing docker images (docker push, docker pull).
- set up a development environment in Docker
is hardware and software you use to write code.

## requirements
General
A README.md file at the root of the alx-pre_course repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project (i.e. 0x01-git), describing what this project is about
Do not use GitHub’s web UI, but the command line to perform the exercise (except for operations that can not possibly be done any other way than through the web UI). You won’t be able to perform many of the task requirements on the web UI, and you should start getting used to the command line for simple tasks because many complex tasks can only be done via the command line.
Your answer files should only contain the command, and nothing else
## More Info
Basic usage
At the end of this project you should be able to reproduce and understand these command lines:

$ git clone <repo>
$ touch test
$ git add test
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"
$ git push origin main
