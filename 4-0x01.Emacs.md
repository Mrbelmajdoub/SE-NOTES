# 0x01. EMACS
## learning objectives
 explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
What is Emacs: editor, costumizable, extensible.
Who is Richard Stallman
How to open and save files: C-x-f to open, C-x-s to save
What is a buffer and how to switch from one to the other: buffer is a text. check with C-x-b and switch with C-x b.
How to use the mark and the point to set the region: mark with C-space until cursor (the point) to set the region 
How to cut and paste lines and regions: C-k to cut and C-p to paste
How to search forward and backward: search with C-s and reverse with C-r
How to invoke commands by name: C-h x
How to undo: C-u
How to cancel half-entered commands: C-g
How to quit Emacs: C-x-c

### Shell
- manpage. shell is a tool that manages most Unix sys,you need a minimum number of commends to easily interact with a system. while the commands can be easy to remember, the options and their use is not. the solution for that is the man command, in it NAME summarize the command, Desctiption (3rd) could give more insight if NAME is not clear enough, then SYPNOSIS (2nd) helps understand the command structure. command option parameters, options inside [] are optional, outside of it are mandatory.
- commands, non-exhaustive list of commands and concpts to master:
awk # pattern scanning and processing language
basename # strip directory and suffix from filenames
bg # resumes suspended jobs without bringing them to the foreground
cat # print files
cd # change the shell working directory.
chmod # change file mode
chown # change file owner and group
crontab # maintain crontab files
curl # transfer a URL
cut # remove sections from each line of files
date # display or set date and time
dig # DNS lookup utility
df # report file system disk space usage
diff # compare files line by line
du # estimate file space usage
echo # display a line of text
find # search for files in a directory hierarchy
fg # resumes suspended jobs and bring them to the foreground
grep # print lines matching a pattern
kill # send a signal to a process
less # read file with pagination
ln # create links
ls # list directory contents
lsb_release # print distribution-specific information
lsof # list open files
mkdir # create
mv # move files
nc # arbitrary TCP and UDP connections and listens
netstat # print network connections, routing tables, interface statistics...
nice # execute a utility with an altered scheduling priority
nproc # print the number of processing units available
passwd # change user password
pgrep # look up processes based on name and other attributes
pkill # send signal to processes based on name and other attributes
printenv # print all or part of environment
pwd # print name of current/working directory
top # display Linux processes
tr # translate or delete characters
ps # report a snapshot of the current processes
rm # remove files or directories
rmdir # remove directories
rsync # remote file copy
scp # secure copy (remote file copy program)
sed # stream editor for filtering and transforming text
sleep # suspend execution for an interval of time
sort # sort lines of text file
ssh # OpenSSH SSH client (remote login program)
ssh-keygen # SSH key generation, management and conversion
su # substitute user identity
sudo # execute a command as another user
tail # output the last part of files
tar # manipulate archives files
tr # translate or delete characters
uname # Print operating system name
uniq # report or omit repeated lines
uptime # show how long system has been running
w # Show who is logged on and what they are doing
whereis # locate the binary, source, and manual page files for a command
which # locate a command
wc # print newline, word, and byte counts for each file
xargs # build and execute command lines from standard input
| # redirect standard output to another command
/> # redirect standard output
< # redirect standard input
& # send process to background

- shortcuts (some handy ones)
CTRL+A # go to beginning of line
CTRL+B # moves backward one character
CTRL+C # stops the current command
CTRL+D # deletes one character backward or logs out of current session
CTRL+E # go to end of line
CTRL+F # moves forward one character
CTRL+G # aborts the current editing command and ring the terminal bell
CTRL+K # deletes (kill) forward to end of line
CTRL+L # clears screen and redisplay the line
CTRL+N # next line in command history
CTRL+R # searches in your command history
CTRL+T # transposes two characters
CTRL+U # kills backward to the beginning of line
CTRL+W # kills the word behind the cursor
CTRL+Y # retrieves last deleted string
CTRL+Z # stops the current command, resume with fg in the foreground or bg in the background

### Using Emacs as editor
you can open emacs with command emacs (add& for bg)
tutorial can be done by CTRL-h t
C- will stand for CTRL, and M- for Meta or ALT, and ESC for ESC
- end emacs session C-x-c, quir partially entered commands or commands taking too long wih C-g, stop tutorial C-x k then Enter, >> char at left margin indicate direction to try use a command
- move next screen C-v and back with M-v, C-l redisplay cursor line at center of screen
- cursor controlled with C-p for previous line, C-n for next line, C-b for a char back, C-f for a char forward. M-b for a word back, M-f for a word forward
> meta often operate on unites defined by language (word, sentence, paragraph) while CTRL  units are independent of what you are editing (characters, lines, etc)
- C-a, C-e move to beggining and end of line, but M-a, M-e move by sentence.
- cursor position in text is called "point", cursor show on the screen where point is located in text.
- M-< move to beginning of the whole text(or buffer), M-> moves to end of whole text. you can use C-v, and M-v to move back to original location.
- C-u give repeat count for a command ex C-u 8 C-f, moves 8 char forwrd.
- some commands are disabled as they confuse begginers ex C-x-l 
- for one window (kill all other) C-x 1 and expand window with cursor to full screen, C-x serie of commands have to do with windows, filesm buffers, and related things.
- you can insert by typing char, enter for new line, and del for deleting, C-u can be used to repead insert and delete. C-d delete next char,M-del kills next char,  M-d for next word, C-k to end of line, M-k to end of sentence.(kills can be reinserted, deletes no) reinsert most recent  (yank) with C-y, or M-y for older yanks
- start highlite with C-SPACE untill cursor, delete highlight with C-w
- undo with C-/ or C-_ or C-x u, only text changing commands.
- to make changes permanent you must save text into a file, C-x-f to find a file, file name you type appears at bottom of screen in the minibuffer when used for this sort of input. type enter after inputing the name, file opens to edit, save with C-x-s.finding a files which does not exists create it.
- buffers, if you find another file, the first remains in Emacs, switch back with C-x-f.emacs stors files's text inside an object called buffer, list buffers with C-x-b, C-x 1 to close the list. use C-x b to switch to another buffer. C-x s save some buffers to their file
-exstanding command set, C-x for char extend and M-x fot named command extand (long name instead of a char). C-z suspends emacs so next access resumes it with fg command on terminal as well as %emacs. 
- searching C-s for forward of C-r for reverse. move with backspase and C-s
- split windows with C-x 2, use CM-V to scroll the other window, and C-x o for moving to other window. C-x 4 C-f then name of one of files then enter to open other file down.
- frame is a collection of windows. C-x 5 2 for 2 frams and C-x 5 0 for a single frame
- getting more help C-h ? for help or c C-h c them command for a desctiption. or C-h x then type name of command, or C-h a them type a keyword for a command.

## REQuirement
All tasks must be done inside the sandbox Ubuntu 20.04
Your sandbox must be available at the end of this project - the Checker will access to it at midnight for running the correction!
The answer of a task must be in a specific file
Each answer file must contain only the command to execute in Emacs for solving the task. Example: “What is the command to write buffer to a specified file?” -> the file should contain only C-x C-w
