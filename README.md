# SE-NOTES Overview (edit after learning Markdown writing) (check if possible to tag files or folders)
Notes from my SE learning journey
i will make a folder library indexed by subject and sublink the files under their subjects.
Notes title syntax: number_code_subject:lesson.md
example: 0_0x00_C:Hello_world.md
how to use this repo:
   use folders for subjects, with a note for each lesson then combine learning into 1 note for each subject
  - gather the codes i made to make an organized collection
  - indexing and resource keeping are in this note for now
pending:
 - too many concepts on the 0-welcome on board, come back later.
 - cd man page is about varialble and like a code, interesting to look at later.
 - make an index to link real chronological order with local one.
 - what does explain to anyone in learning objective mean, put in important
