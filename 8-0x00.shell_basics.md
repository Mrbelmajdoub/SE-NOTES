# 0x00. shell, basics

##learning objectives
 explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

#### General
What does RTFM mean? READ THE FUCHING MANUAL
What is a Shebang HASH EXCLAMATION #!
What is the Shell command interpreter to kernel
#### What is the shell
What is the difference between a terminal and a shell terminal is a window in gui that opens a shell session
What is the shell prompt shows you username and type of user as well as current path
How to use the history (the basics) ctrl r to recall then o to run and g to cancel, or up and down to navigate history or ctrl n or p
#### Navigation
What do the commands or built-ins cd, pwd, ls do: change directory, print working directory, list files and directories
How to navigate the filesystem: using cd to change dir through paths or / for root _ for previous or ~ for home, and ls to list or pwd to print your directory location
What are the . and .. directories: current and parent directory
What is the working directory, how to print it and how to change it: it is the directory in which we are active now, pwd to print it, and cd to change it.
What is the root directory: the beggining of the file system.
What is the home directory, and how to go there: where users can put their data, get ther with cd ~ or cd /home/[username]
What is the difference between the root directory and the home directory of the user root: home directory of root user is /root dirctory in the root of the filesystem.
What are the characteristics of hidden files and how to list them: they start with a dot and to list them add -a option to ls command
What does the command cd - do, go to previous directory
#### Looking Around
What do the commands ls, less, file do: ls list files and directories, less read text files and display them on screen, file tells you the type of file, if text or executable compressed etc...
How do you use options and arguments with commandsafter commands you put option using - followed by a single char command of -- followed by a long form command
Understand the ls long format and how to display it: it shows permissions then link count (how many point to the same data) owner, group, size in bytes, mod time then file name.
[A Guided Tour] (https://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0040.php)
What does the ln command do: it creates a symbolic link to a file, points to the data the original file points to.
What do you find in the most common/important directories: sysem configuration files, pretected, 
What is a symbolic link: pointer to original file's content
What is a hard link: copy
What is the difference between a hard link and a symbolic link:hard links point to same data, symbolic links point to pathname.
#### Manipulating Files
What do the commands cp, mv, rm, mkdir do: copu, move (rename), remove, make directory
What are wildcards and how do they work: wildcards are characters that sygnify a pattern, to help costumize the experience using patterns
How to use wildcards: insert them in text, commands, 
#### Working with Commands
What do type, which, help, man commands do: type shows the type of commands(how shell interprets the command), which shows location if executable progran, help for bash built-ins and man show documentation and manuals
What are the different kinds of commands: executable programs, built-ins, alias, shell functions
What is an alias: command that calls another (or group) or command
When do you use the command help instead of man when we need to just see the options and short description or built in bash commands and not external commands
#### Reading Man Pages
How to read a man page: name, sypnosis (if not clear see description), syntax, then options
What are man page sections: name, sypnosis,syntax, description, options
What are the section numbers for User commands, System calls and Library functions: 1 for user commands, 2 for system calls, 3 for library functions, so man 1 ls to read about ls command, man 2 open to see hoe open() works at os level, man 3 printf to read about how it formats and prints output.

#### LTS
What does LTS mean? LONG TERM SUPPORT

## requirement
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
All your scripts should be exactly two lines long ($ wc -l file should print 2)
All your files should end with a new line (why?) because in unix, text file consist of series of lines each ends with newline character (\n), if a file is not empty and does not end with a newline, it is not a text file.
The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
A README.md file at the root of the repo, containing a description of the repository
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, describing what each script is doing
You are not allowed to use backticks, &&, || or ;
All your scripts must be executable. To make your file executable, use the chmod command: chmod u+x file. Later, we’ll learn more about how to utilize this command.
More Info
Example of line count and first line

julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ wc -l 12-file_type 
2 12-file_type
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ head -n 1 12-file_type 
#!/bin/bash
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ 
In order to test your scripts, you will need to use this command: chmod u+x file. We will see later what does chmod mean and do, but you can have a look at man chmod if you are curious.

Example

julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls
12-file_type
lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -la lll
-rw-rw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ cat lll
#!/bin/bash
ls
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -l lll
-rw-rw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ chmod u+x lll # you do not have to understand this yet
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ls -l lll
-rwxrw-r-- 1 julien julien 15 Sep 19 21:05 lll
julien@ubuntu:/tmp$ ./lll
12-file_type

### What Is “The Shell”?
-the shell is a program that takes commands from keyboard to os. on most os, a program called bash (enhenced version of sh(steve bourne)) acts as a shell program.
-terminal rmulator lets you interact with shell through a window. (in gui). windows and other os have terminal emulator to grant a shell session
- first thing we see in terminal window is a shell prompt with our username and the name of the machine followed by a dollar sign. if the last character is #, then you are operating as root, that is dangerous.
- you can type a command and initiate it with enter, you can recall commands history with up and down arrows.
- i recomend using focus follows mouse instead of click to focus on your os manager.
### Navigation
pwd, cd, ls
- Done in shell navigation lesson
### Looking Around
ls, less, file
- Done in shell looking around lesson
### A Guided Tour
interesting places to explore, cd into the following dirs, ls, file command interesting files, less for text files, lets start:
- /: root dir, where file sys begin
- /boot: where linux kernel and boot loader are kept, kernel is file called vmlinuz
- /etc: contains configuration files for the sys, only text files, /passwd contain essential info for each user, where accounts are defined, /fstab table of mounted devices when sys boots, defines sys disk drives, /hosts list network host nemes and IP addresses that are intrinsically known to the sys, /init.d contains the scripts that start various sys services at boot time.
- /bin, /usr/bin: These two directories contain most of the programs for the system. The /bin directory has the essential programs that the system requires to operate, while /usr/bin contains applications for the system's users.
- /sbin, /user/sbin: The sbin directories contain programs for system administration, mostly for use by the superuser.
- /usr: The /usr directory contains a variety of things that support user applications. Some highlights:
/usr/share/X11
Support files for the X Window system
/usr/share/dict
Dictionaries for the spelling checker. Yes, Linux comes with a spelling checker. See look and aspell.
/usr/share/doc
Various documentation files in a variety of formats.
/usr/share/man
The man pages are kept here.
- /usr/local: 	/usr/local and its subdirectories are used for the installation of software and other files for use on the local machine. What this really means is that software that is not part of the official distribution (which usually goes in /usr/bin) goes here.

When you find interesting programs to install on your system, they should be installed in one of the /usr/local directories. Most often, the directory of choice is /usr/local/bin.
- /var: 	The /var directory contains files that change as the system is running. This includes:
/var/log
Directory that contains log files. These are updated as the system runs. It's a good idea to view the files in this directory from time to time, to monitor the health of your system.
/var/spool
This directory is used to hold files that are queued for some process, such as mail messages and print jobs. When a user's mail first arrives on the local system (assuming it has local mail, a rare occurrence on modern machines that are not mail servers), the messages are first stored in /var/spool/mai
- /lib: The shared libraries (similar to DLLs in that other operating system) are kept here.
- /home: /home is where users keep their personal work. In general, this is the only place users are allowed to write files. This keeps things nice and clean :-)
- /root: is the superuser's home dir
- /tmp: in which programms write their temporary files
- /dev: The /dev directory is a special directory, since it does not really contain files in the usual sense. Rather, it contains devices that are available to the system. In Linux (like Unix), devices are treated like files. You can read and write devices as though they were files. For example /dev/fd0 is the first floppy disk drive, /dev/sda is the first hard drive. All the devices that the kernel understands are represented here.
- /proc: 	The /proc directory is also special. This directory does not contain files. In fact, this directory does not really exist at all. It is entirely virtual. The /proc directory contains little peep holes into the kernel itself. There are a group of numbered entries in this directory that correspond to all the processes running on the system. In addition, there are a number of named entries that permit access to the current configuration of the system. Many of these entries can be viewed. Try viewing /proc/cpuinfo. This entry will tell you what the kernel thinks of the system's CPU.
- /media: Finally, we come to /media, a normal directory which is used in a special way. The /media directory is used for mount points. As we learned in the second lesson, the different physical storage devices (like hard disk drives) are attached to the file system tree in various places. This process of attaching a device to the tree is called mounting. For a device to be available, it must first be mounted.
When your system boots, it reads a list of mounting instructions in the /etc/fstab file, which describes which device is mounted at which mount point in the directory tree. This takes care of the hard drives, but we may also have devices that are considered temporary, such as optical disks and USB storage devices. Since these are removable, they do not stay mounted all the time. The /media directory is used by the automatic device mounting mechanisms found in modern desktop oriented Linux distributions. To see what devices and mount points are used, type mount.
-you can use ln command to create symbolic links. they are special type of file that pointsto another file, it allows a single file to have multiple names, its like a pointer to the original file.
### Manipulating Files
cp, mv, rm, mkdir
- Done before
### Working With Commands
- type: display info about command type
- which: locate a command, only works for actual executable programs
- help: display reference page for shell builtin
- man: display an on-line command reference.
- the 4 kind of commands: 
	1. executable program programs can be compiled binaries
	2. command built into the shell itself (shell builtins)
	3. shell function, miniature shell scripts incorporated into environment (configuring environment and writing shell scripts are possible)
	4. alias, command defined by us, built from other commands
- README and other documentation files reside in /usr/share/doc directoru, most in plain text format or HTML or end with ".gz" indication gzip compression, which you can read with zless. 

### Reading Man pages
man man
### Keyboard shortcuts for Bash ctrl + (mostly)
- processes: C to kill (interupt), Z to suspend current foreground process running in bash, D to close the bash shell.
- screen: L to clear, s to stop output to screen (when not willing to use c, q resume output to screen after using the s.
- cursor: a or home to begining of line, e or end to end of line, b for back  and f for forward (alt for word). XX move between beg of line and curent position of cursor (switch between the two)
- delete text: D or delete for char, alt d for all char after cursor on current line, h or backspace for char before cursor
- fixing typos: alt + t swap current word with previous, t for char, _ for undo last key press.
- cutting and pasting: w word, k line after cursor, u line before cursor, y paste last cut
- capitalizing char: alt + u every char uppercase to end of word, alt + l lowercase to end of word, alt + c to char under cursor.
- tab completion: tab to autocomplte file, dir, or command
- command history: p or up arrow: prevous command, N or down arrow: next command in history, alt + r revert any changes to a command pulled from history then edited. R recall last command matching char provided, o run what found in R, G leave history searching mode. 
### LTS
long term support ubuntu is released every two years, each have 5 years support
### Shebang #!
is a file with it is used as executable in unix like os, the program loader  parces the rest of the files's initial line as an intrpreter directive.if it startt with #! /bin/sh then program loader isinstructed to run /bin/sh.
syntax: #! interpreter [ortional-one-arg-only]   in which interpreter is a path to an executable. space after shebang is optional.
### man or help:

cd
ls
pwd
less
file
ln
cp
mv
rm
mkdir
