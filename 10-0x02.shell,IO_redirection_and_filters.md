# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

## learning objectives
 explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

Shell, I/O Redirection
What do the commands head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep, tr do:  print head of file print tail of file, search for file in adirectory hierarchy, count newline, line, words, characters, bytes; sort input into a order, delete duplicate files, print matches to a pattern
How to redirect standard output to a file:  >
How to get standard input from a file instead of the keyboard: <
How to send the output from one program to the input of another program:  |
How to combine commands and filters with redirections: redirect output to filter commands to have better readability of the output
Special Characters
What are special characters: hold interpretation by Bash
Understand what do the white spaces, single quotes, double quotes, backslash, comment, pipe, command separator, tilde and how and when to use them: end and start of word, ignore meaning of special char inside, ignore whitespece and tread all inside as one word, ignore next char interpretation, ignored by bash as comment, redirect a command input into another, allows multiple commands in a single line, means user home directory. use them on command line to allow more powerful usage and use them by putting them as input
Other Man Pages
How to display a line of text: echo
How to concatenate files and print on the standard output: cat
How to reverse a string: rev
How to remove sections from each line of files: use cut to extract (keep) the parts you want, effectivly removing the rest.
What is the /etc/passwd file and what is its format: hold user info in oneline separated by :
What is the /etc/shadow file and what is its format: hold user  encrypted password

### Shell, I/O Redirection
a powerful feature of command line programs is input/output redirection. by using special notions we can redirect output of many commandsoto files, devices, and even to the input of other commands.
most command line that display their results by sending to a facility called standard output
. to redirect standart output to a file we use ">" like ls > file.txt. each repeat of the command, the file is overwritten. to append you can use ">>". then results add to end of file making the file longer with each command repeat. file is created if it doesnot exist.
most command lines accept input from a facily called standard input. by standart it takes from the keyboard. can be redirected from a file using "<" like sort < file.txt. or we can use sort < file.txt > sortedfile.txt to have both input and output redirected.
pipelines | are used to connect multiple commands, it feeds standard output of a command into standard input of another command. like ls -l | less. makes any command have scrolling output. head displays 10 top lines.
filters commands are frequently used with pipelines, they perform an operation on the standard input and send it to standart output. they help process info in poweful ways:
	- sort: sort standard input into standard output
	- uniq: given sorted stream of data, it removes duplicate lines of data (makes sure every line of data is uniq)
	- grep: examines each line of data it recieves and outputs every line that contains a specific pattern
	- fmt: output text into a formatted text
	- pr: splits data into pages with page breaks, headers and footers in preparation of printing
	- head: output first few lines of input
	- tail: outputs last few lines of input
	- tr: translate characters (like upeercase/lowercase conversion, etc)
	- sed: stream editor, more sophisticated tr
	- awk: entire programming language designed for constructing filters. extremely powerful.

### Special Characters
characters given non-literal meaning by Bash. they carry special instruction or alternate meaning. called special characters or meta-characters.
- " " whitespace- tab, newline, vertical tab, form feed, carriage return, or space. determines where words end and begin. the first word is the command name, additional words become arguments to that command.
- $ expansion- introduces various types of expansion:parameter expansion $var or ${var}, command substitution ($(command)) or arithmatic expansion $((expression)). and more
- '' single quotes- protect text inside to be taken as literal meaning, inside any kind of interpretation by bash is ignored.
- "" double quotes- protect text inside from being split into multiple words or arguments yet allowa substitutions to occur. meaning of most other characters is usually prevented
- / escape- prevents next char from being interpreted as special character, works outside outside quotes, double quotes but generally ignored in sigle quotes
- # comment- begins a commentary that extands to end of line. not processed by the shell
- = assignment- assign value to a variable, no whitespace at either side of the = char.
- [[]] test- evaluation of conditional expression to determine whether it is true or false. used in bash to compare strings, check file existance etc.
- ! negate- used to negate or reverse a test or exit status
- >, >>, <, redirection- redirect commands's output or input to a file
- | pipe- send output from a command to input into another command
- ; command separator- used to separate multiple commands that are on the same line
- {} inline group- commands inside are treated as if they are one command
- () subshell group- same as above but commans inside are executed in a subshell. sandboxed.
- (()) arithmetic expression- + - * / are used for calculation.
- $(()) arithmatic expenssion. same above but  expression is replaced wit results of its arithmetic value
- * ? Globs- wildcard chars which match parts of a filename
- ~ home directory- alone or followed by / means current users home dir, otherwise a username must be specified
- & -backgroung- end used at end of commands, run command in the backgroung (do not wait for it to complete)
+ recocnized bt not recommended characters:
	- '' command substitution
	- [] text
	- $[] arithmetic expression
### man or help:

echo: displys a line of text
cat: concatenate files and print of standart input 
head: display first few lines
tail: displays last few lines
find: search for file in a directory hierarchy
wc: print newline, word, and byte conts for each file
sort: sort lines of text files
uniq:report or omit repeated lines
grep: print lines that match patterns
tr: translate or delete characters
rev: reverse lines characterwise from a file
cut: removes sections from each line of files
passwd (5) (i.e. man 5 passwd): file etc/passwd contain user info including optional encrypted password
