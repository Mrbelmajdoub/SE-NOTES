#Important

- navigating projects:
Check Learning Objectives.
Review foundational concepts.
Utilize available resources.
Explore YouTube tutorials for visual learning.

- the framework
**break problem into smaller easier ones, do not guess solution even if they work, understand all concepts to develop critical thinking and  think like an engineer. use paper or whiteboard to keep mind active and maintain focus, when solution is finished, turn it into code. understand why it is important to spend time on the topic of the day and how it plays a role in the system or comprehension of CS, keep the big picture in mind. don't look at poeples code or copy it, understand them make your write on your own. your goal is not to become great students. Your goal is to become great software engineers, because no one wants to hire students**
0. read everything (skim and scan for objectives) and experiment.
1. think, understand, rest, think of a solution. rephrase problem "what am i trying to accomplish here?" then go through examples "with this input, parameter,  etc, i should output, return, etc,"  then "what edge cases i have to consider here" then focus on base case "what should my algorithm be?" when found run it on different examples on whiteboard or paper to see if it meets expectation, then find changes for edge cases to work.
2. think more + whiteboard to visualize easier
3. ask why whether it works or not. for example if it is bit manipulation, then Why do you think this is important? Is it important? Why binary? Where do bits play a role? How is it connected to the machine, memory, bytes and values of types?
4. if you don't understand, read error message
5. if still missing solution, google only specifics
6. google with more context
7. ask chatgpt 8. use it for learning (simpler explanation, more additional more detailed question, find bug), not for faster more effective solution. nover copy paste its code, understand it, close window, code it yourself. at end of project ask it for “I am a software engineering student and I had to create a function that {describe the function} This is my code {paste your code here>}. Do you see a way to improve it? If so, can you explain how and why?”.

- from onboarding:
my natural resources(use them intentionaly): 1. time: relative, spending in A means postponing B 2. attention: relative, what you spend attention on become the center of your attention. 3. enerdy is dynamic, it neither be created or destroyed, just transfered from A to B.
daily, capture, clarify and organize, engage. then weekly review.
goal: to identify a habit to change and find an alternative routine that retains the same cue and reward                                step 1 identifying the habit(write it): be precise and specific, visualize a certain behavior in time and space. ex instead of "i procrastinate" say " i get distracted on the phone a lot".                                                                    step 2: identify (draw) the cue, routine, and reward , ex 1 cue: i am stressed. 2 routine : i take the phone to scroll instagram 3 prize: i get distracted and i lower the stress.                                                                              step 3: put this habit into action! write it in this format (the habit = cue + routine + reward)


- time management for software engineers
1. monthly sprint(task allocation)
2. task deconposition (each 3 days at most, track, time taken, anddiscuss estimate correctness on next sprint to improve eatimation)
3. priortization (rank every task in interval of 10, by visualizing dependency and priority, so you leave space to insert tasks and
4. organize tasks by time blocking time you won't be able to work on this task, then fill empty spaces by tasks starting by the lower dependency and leave some buffer time.)
5. reflect at end of sprint.
